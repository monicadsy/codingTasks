I'm currently a software engineering bootcamp student who is passionate about using what I learnt to solve problems, automating stuff and building software.

I uploaded some of my coding tasks which I hope could help you understand what can be learnt as part of the software engineering bootcamp

- 📚 Task 4 Iteration: allows us to simplify our algorithm and makes designing algorithms quicker and simpler 
- 📚 Task 9: OOP Classes: model and solve complex real-world problems where the objects in your code map to real-world objects.
- 📚 Task 17 Unit Testing:  a crucial aspect of software development to ensure codes work properly
